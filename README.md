## üéÆ Overview

**Java Pok√©mon Ga-Ol√©** is a simplified turn-based battling game inspired by the Pok√©mon franchise. It runs entirely in the terminal and allows players to choose Pok√©mon, execute attacks, and engage in one-on-one battles. The project was built with a strong focus on applying fundamental object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## üß† Key Concepts Used

This project was designed not only for gameplay, but also as a practical implementation of key OOP principles:

- **Encapsulation**: Pok√©mon and battle logic are contained within their respective classes, with controlled access to fields and methods.
- **Inheritance**: A base `Pokemon` class is extended by various specific Pok√©mon types to share common behavior and structure.
- **Polymorphism**: Attack methods and behaviors vary dynamically based on the type of Pok√©mon selected by the player.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Fully interactive terminal-based UI
- Turn-based battle mechanics
- Multiple Pok√©mon types with unique attributes and attack styles
- Modular design for easy extension or modification
- Simple, readable code structure suitable for learning purposes
